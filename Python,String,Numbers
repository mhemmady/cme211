Python
  Run python 3 interpreter with $ python3
  Exit interpreter: exit() or ctrl-d

  create a python script ($ nano xxxx.py)
  execute python script ($ python3 xxxx.py)

Integers and floating point
  Floor division: 5//3 rounds down --> 1 (would have been 1.667)
  Modulus Operator: % returns remainder for integer division (8%3 = 2)
  Exponent: **

Modules
  python has modules (collection of python resources)
  have to import module
  math module to use sqrt
    import math
    math.sqrt(9)

Print:
  print(x) or print("hello") - ends in a new line character
  print("hello", end=' ') - no new line after
  print("x","y") - separated by space
  print ("x","y",', ')
  str(P) -- P is a number, but convert it to a string
  
Values, Types, Variables:
  values: the data (could be string, numbers, boolean values, etc.)
  types: values have types (bool, str, int, float)
  variables: associate a name to a value
    start with letter or underscore

Convert string/number
a = str(55)
a = float(“99.45”)

Strings:
slicing - can slice strings
Can access just one character of a string, but cannot change a part of a string.
You can add strings together, or different parts of strings together
  Format:
  r = 1
  a = 2*math.pi
  print("the area of a circle of radius {0} is {1}.”.format(r,a))
  the area of a circle of radius 1 is 6.283
