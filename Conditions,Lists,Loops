BOOLEAN
Logical operators return boolean values
Floating point numbers should not be tested for equality, rather approximate values
  can use:
    import math
    math.isclose(,1,.21-.11) returns true

Boolean operations:
  x or y: x or y has to be true to return true. else, false
  x and y: both x and y have to be true to return true. else, false
  not x: if x is false, then true. else, false

LOOPS
If:
  only executed if statement is true

If-else:
  If
  else if (elif)
  else:

True:
  non-boolean values can be true or false

LISTS
Lists = vectors
  length of list: len(x)
  can slice a list
  add, multiply lists
  lists are mutable (elements can be changed)

= refers to the same global object, doesnt create a new object

Can shuffle and sort lists. Look up list operations.

Range function exists to create lists or range of numbers

LOOPS
For loops with lists
  for item in my_list
    print(item)

  for i in range(8):

Loops:
continue: ??
break: break out of current loop
pass: come back to implement it later
